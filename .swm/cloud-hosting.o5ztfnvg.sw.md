## Our needs

#### Hosting

- Documentation website
- Plugins
- Database (accounts and related matters)

#### Performance expected

- few hundreds (thousands **max**) of requests for both website & database -> not really a need for scalability

#### Team resources

- students
- need something that is both OK for budget but performing enough

### Conclusion

For *now*, «Pro» account option seems like a solution to explore
