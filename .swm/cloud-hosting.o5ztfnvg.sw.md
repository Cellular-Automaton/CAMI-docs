| Performance | 10.99€/month | 500Go      | Multiple            | ssh    | 4x1Go    | No limit     |

## VPS

- Also available for websites
- Overall cheaper, and monthly subscription available
- No CMS, but 40Go storage space
- from 5€/month (no engagement)

## Our needs

#### Hosting

- Documentation website
- Plugins
- Database (accounts and related matters)

#### Performance expected

- few hundreds (thousands **max**) of requests for both website & database -> not really a need for scalability

#### Team resources

- students
- need something that is both OK for budget but performing enough

### Conclusion

For *now*, «Pro» account option seems like a solution to explore if we can pay the yearly subscription\
**But**, the VPS would be cheaper if we use it for less than a year
